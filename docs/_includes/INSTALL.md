## Meerkat - For a Transparent Market

Meerkat gives you tools to make better decisions about buying things from online marketplaces.

The product history (the legal way*) shows you the differences from the first time you saw the product on the marketplace.

Adds commenting ability to every product on the marketplace. This way customers can share their experiences, even if the marketplace doesn't provide this feature.

### Currently supported sites:
* hasznaltauto.hu
* ingatlan.com
* ingatlan.jofogas.hu

### We are comparing product data the legal way
* No third party database to store the data. We are storing the products properties in the customer's browser.
* No scraping algorithm. We only store the products the customer actually saw.
